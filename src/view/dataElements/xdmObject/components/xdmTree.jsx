// Importing Ant's tree styles in other ways can bring in global styles
// that affect all elements which, at the time this is written, negatively affects things
// like positioning of error icons within react-spectrum textfields when the field
// is marked invalid. Check https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/9363
// before attempting to change this import.
// By default, Ant's Tree animates while expanding or collapsing a node. This animation
// requires additional CSS that would bring some of these global styles in.
// To avoid the issue (and speed up the Tree experience), we disable animation
// by setting Tree's motion prop to null. This isn't currently a documented prop:
