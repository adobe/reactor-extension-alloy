 * The model representing a node within the form state.
 * @typedef {Object} FormStateNode
 * @property {string} id A unique identifier for the node.
 * @property {Object} schema The XDM schema for the node.
 * @property {string} autoPopulationSource The source of auto population for this node
 * @property {string} contextKey The context that could auto populate this field
 * @property {Object} properties If the schema type is "object"",
 * this will represent properties of the object as defined by the
 * schema. The keys are the property names and the values are their
 * respective form state nodes.
 * @property {Array} items If the schema type is "array"",
 * this will represent the items within the array as defined by
 * the user (the schema says what each item in an array must look like,
 * but the user adds the items to the array).
 * @property {boolean} isPartsPopulationStrategySupported Whether the
 * user should be able to populate parts of the node. In other words,
 * the node represents an object or an array and a schema has been
 * provided for the object's properties or the array's items.
 * @property {string} populationStrategy Indicates which population
 * strategy the user is taking to populate the node's value.
 * @property {string} value The value that a user has provided for
 * the whole node. This is only pertinent when the population strategy
 * is set to WHOLE. If the the user has set the population strategy to
 * PARTS, it will be ignored. We don't clear out value when the
 * user switches populationStrategy to PARTS, because the user might
 * switch back to WHOLE and we'd like to be able to show the value
 * they had previously entered.
 * @property {boolean} updateMode Whether the UI is in update mode.
 * This controls the clear existing value checkboxes.
 * @property {Object} transform Set of transforms to apply to this node. Currently
 * only clear: boolean is supported.
 * @property {string} nodePath The node path in dot notation.

/**
 * Generates the initial form state. Note that parts of the state
 * aren't intended to be modified and have less to do with "values"
 * and more to do with constant metadata that corresponds to a
 * particular node (for example, the XDM schema that describes the node)
 * and is made available for convenient access so it doesn't have to
 * be repeatedly computed on every render.
 *
 * @param {Object} sandboxMeta The sandbox meta object.
 * @param {Object} schema The XDM schema that describes the node.
 * @param {*} [value] The previously persisted value for the node. This
 * will only be defined when the user is reloading the extension view
 * with previously saved data.
 * @param {string} [nodePath] The dot-delimited path to the node within
 * the schema. For example, in an object that looks like this:
 * <code>{ foo: { bar: "abc" } }</code>
 * The path for bar would be "foo.bar".
 * @returns FormStateNode
