# Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK Tags extension

This repository is for the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK [Tags](https://www.adobe.com/experience-platform/launch.html) extension.

Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK is a client-side JavaScript library that allows customers of Adobe Experience Cloud and Adobe Experience Platform to interact with various services through the Platform Edge Network. The library itself is also available [here](https://github.com/adobe/alloy) for use with other client-side tag management systems, or directly in websites.
