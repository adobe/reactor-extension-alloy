/**
 * This script is loaded by TestCafe onto the page that's under test. TestCafe by default
 * fails tests if it sees there were unhandled errors. In our case, we want to test foreseeable
 * error cases, like when the user doesn't have access to Adobe Experience Platform. In these cases,
 * we throw a UserReportableError, which is displayed by the ErrorBoundary with an appropriate message.
 * From a functional test, we then assert that the ErrorBoundary displays the error we expected to be
 * shown. The ErrorBoundary, however, does not prevent the error from continuing to bubble up through
 * the stack trace, so TestCafe would typically see that as an unhandled error. This script helps
 * ensure that errors we've foreseen and appropriately handled are not considered unhandled. We typically
 * only want the test to fail if there's something wrong with our code.

  // UserReportableErrors are intended to be shown to the user within an error boundary.
  // Error boundaries, however, do not change the error from being considered unhandled to
  // handled. Because of this, the unhandled error would typically make TestCafe fail
  // the test. We often test these error cases though, so the fact that the error went
  // unhandled really shouldn't fail the test. This code prevents the error from failing
  // the test. Note that if the error is a UserReportableError but was _not_ displayed inside an
  // error boundary (for example, the error was thrown within async code and reportAsyncError
  // was not used), we would really prefer that it fail the test, but this is unfeasible
  // because the error boundary only exposes the error to our application code _after_ our
  // event listener here as been called. In other words, there's no robust way to know
  // whether the error will end up being reported in the error boundary. We're left to
  // assume it will.
