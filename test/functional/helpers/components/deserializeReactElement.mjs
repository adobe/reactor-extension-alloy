/**
 * This function receives an element object produced by React.createElement.

 * element type. For each element, the deserialization process looks to see
 * if a custom React component is available for the provided element type string.
 * If a component is found, the element type (which is a string) will be replaced
 * with the custom component function. This will allow React to render the element
 * using the proper custom components when the deserialized element is passed
 * into React.render.
 *
 * @param {Object} options.element The element object
 * (produced by React.createElement) to deserialize.
 * @param {Object} options.components The custom components available to be used by
 * the react element or its descendents. The keys are the element types
 * and the values are the corresponding component functions.
